# Heart-attack-prediction-and-Income-Classification
Heart attack prediction and income classification are two datasets that are commonly used in data science and machine learning applications. The datasets provide a wealth of information that can be used to develop predictive models and gain insights into various aspects of health and financial well-being.
The process involves several steps, including data cleaning, feature selection, model training, and model evaluation, to ensure that the resulting models are accurate and reliable. 
Apply the models on selected data sets is to derive meaningful insights from complex data sets and make informed decisions based on the analysis.
For prediction, KNN and Support Vector Machine(SVM) machine learning algorithms for Heart-attack Analysis XGBoost, Random Forest Classifier for Income Classification were used.
